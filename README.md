# Lego_Smart_City
![One Building Complete!](https://www.vjs3d.cc/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_0229-scaled.jpeg)
A Lego City with lights, traffic screens, sensors and more. All made using Lego Arduino, electronic components and a little bit of 3D printing.
So far this is just an idea, hopefully to be a reality...
